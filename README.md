# California-Housing-Price-Prediction-
In this project, I will be documenting my full experience with developing a machine learning model to predict housing prices.  

# Framing the Problem. 
Firstly, it is important to clearly define the objective. Knowing the objective is important because it will determine how you frame the problem, which algorithms to use, and how much effort you will spend. 

Secondly, it could be helpful to look at the currently solution to the problem if any.  

# Explore the Data Set. 

After figuing out the objective, we can determine what kind of supervision the model will need.
